;[] is a vector more like a array
;Vectors are also ordered collections of items. They are ideal when new items will be added to or removed from the back (constant-time).
; This means that using conj is more efficient than cons for adding items.
; They are efficient (constant time) for finding (using nth) or changing (using assoc) items by index.
;Function definitions specify their parameter list using a vector.
; # is anonymous function and % is each item from list
