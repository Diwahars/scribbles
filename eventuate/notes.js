'Akka Persistence' - AKKA 2.4

enables stateful actors to persist their internal state so that it can be recovered when
	1 an actor is started,
	2 restarted after a JVM crash or by a supervisor,
	3 migrated in a cluster.
The key concept behind Akka persistence is that only changes to an actor internal state are persisted but never its current state directly (except for optional snapshots).
These changes are only ever appended to storage, nothing is ever mutated, which allows for very high transaction rates and efficient replication.
Stateful actors are recovered by replaying stored changes to these actors from which they can rebuild internal state.
This can be either the full history of changes or starting from a snapshot which can dramatically reduce recovery times.
Akka persistence also provides point-to-point communication with at-least-once message delivery semantics.

persistence plugins
	1 including in-memory heap based journal,
	2 local file-system based snapshot-store
	3 LevelDB based journal.

'Architecture':
1 'PersistentActor':
	write events to journal, can replay and restore state.
	can be both command or event-sourced actor
2 'PersistentView':
	can read from the events from PersistentActor, but cannot produce events itself
3 'AtLeastOnceDelivery':
	To send messages with at-least-once delivery semantics to destinations, also in case of sender and receiver JVM crashes.
4 'AsynchWriteJournal':
	persistence of events to pluggable storages
5 'snapshot'
	hasten recovery time, pluggable storages

'Event Sourcing'
A persistent actor receives a (non-persistent) 'command' which is first 'validated' if it can be applied to the current state.
Here, validation can mean anything, from simple inspection of a command message fields up to a conversation with several external services, for example.
If validation succeeds, 'events are generated' from the command, representing the effect of the command.
These 'events are then persisted and, after successful persistence, used to change the actor's state.
When the persistent actor needs to be recovered, only the persisted events are replayed of which we know that they can be successfully applied.
In other words, events cannot fail when being replayed to a persistent actor, in contrast to commands.
Event sourced actors may of course also process commands that do not change application state, such as 'query commands', for example.

'------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
'PersistentActor'
	'receiveCommand'(event)
		1 'persist'(event) (event-handler) =>
			1.1 event-handler has handle to sender
			1.2 events are 'stashed' 1 event and its event-handler execution (blocking), so low throughput
		2 'persistAsynch' => no stashing (non-blocking), batch writes also increase throughput
		3 'deferAsynch' => recommended for read commands

	'receiveRecover'(event)
		event from persist
		snap

Nested => persist, persistAsynch can be nested within each other, ordering is guranteed.

'Failure'
If persistence of an event fails,
	'onPersistFailure' will be invoked and the actor will unconditionally be stopped.
If persistence of an event is rejected before it is stored, e.g. due to serialization error,
	'onPersistRejected' will be invoked and the actor continues with next message.
If there is a problem with recovering the state of the actor from the journal when the actor is started,
	'onRecoveryFailure' is called (logging the error by default) and the actor will be stopped.

'Deletion' => rarely used, but mostly in conjuction with snapshotting
Stopping a PersistentActor with PoisonPill message can cause stahed commands to be lost prematurely

'snapshots'
Persistent actors can save snapshots of internal state by calling the saveSnapshot method
(SaveSnapshotSuccess message, otherwise a SaveSnapshotFailure message

		var state: Any = _

		override def receiveCommand: Receive = {
		  case "snap"                                => saveSnapshot(state)
		  case SaveSnapshotSuccess(metadata)         => // ...
		  case SaveSnapshotFailure(metadata, reason) => // ...
		}
		override def receiveRecover: Receive = {
		  case SnapshotOffer(metadata, offeredSnapshot) => state = offeredSnapshot
		  case RecoveryCompleted                        =>
		  case event                                    => // ...
		}
snapshots can be deleted, have a lifecycle on its own

'Persistence Query'
PersistentView is deprecated. Use Persistence Query instead.
PersistentView is tied to reading from one entity event stream,
but Query API allows using 'Akka Streams' module for querying the journal and retrieving streams of events.

object StreamingJournalQueries {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    implicit val system = ActorSystem()
    implicit val materializer = ActorMaterializer()

    // create a ReadJournal for LevelDB journal backend
    val readJournal =
      PersistenceQuery(system).readJournalFor[LeveldbReadJournal](LeveldbReadJournal.Identifier)

    // create a query for all events associated with a specific persistent entity as a Source of events
    val source: Source[EventEnvelope, Unit] =
      readJournal.eventsByPersistenceId("entity-1234", 0, Long.MaxValue)

    // materialize the query with a Sink printing out events
    source.runForeach(envelope â‡’ println(envelope.event))
  }
}

'at-least-once delivery'
To send messages with at-least-once delivery semantics to destinations you can mix-in 'AtLeastOnceDelivery' trait to your PersistentActor on the sending side.
It takes care of re-sending messages when they have not been confirmed within a configurable timeout.

		import akka.actor.{ Actor, ActorSelection }
		import akka.persistence.AtLeastOnceDelivery

		case class Msg(deliveryId: Long, s: String)
		case class Confirm(deliveryId: Long)

		sealed trait Evt
		case class MsgSent(s: String) extends Evt
		case class MsgConfirmed(deliveryId: Long) extends Evt

		class MyPersistentActor(destination: ActorSelection)  extends PersistentActor with AtLeastOnceDelivery {
		  override def persistenceId: String = "persistence-id"
		  override def receiveCommand: Receive = {
			    case s: String   => persist(MsgSent(s))(updateState)
			    case Confirm(deliveryId) => persist(MsgConfirmed(deliveryId))(updateState)
		  }
		  override def receiveRecover: Receive = {
		    	case evt: Evt => updateState(evt)
		  }
		  def updateState(evt: Evt): Unit = evt match {
			    case MsgSent(s) =>
			      deliver(destination)(deliveryId => Msg(deliveryId, s))
			    case MsgConfirmed(deliveryId) => confirmDelivery(deliveryId)
		  }
		}

		class MyDestination extends Actor {
		  def receive = {
		    case Msg(deliveryId, s) =>
		      sender() ! Confirm(deliveryId)
		  }
		}

EventAdaptor=>separate journal event schema from domain event
FSM Actors => domain events change state of actor
Storage Plugins => community plugins available for Cassandra, Kafka, MySQL
A journal plugin extends AsyncWriteJournal, AsyncRecovery
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------'
'Schema Evolution'

Default is java serialization, dont use it for Prod.
pluggable schema mechanisms -> Avro, Thrift, ProtocolBuf..
serialization bindings can be at each message type level.
