HDFS:
-----
1) An HDFS cluster has two types of node operating in a master-worker pattern: a name-
node (the master) and a number of datanodes (workers).
2) The namenode manages the filesystem namespace. It maintains the filesystem tree and
   the metadata for all the files and directories in the tree.
   For example, one namenode might manage all the block pools rooted under /user, say, and a second
   namenode might handle files(blocks) under /share.
   Files are stored in blocks(64MB, read about seek/transfer speed)

3) Datanodes are the workhorses of the filesystem. They store and retrieve blocks when
   they are told to (by clients or the namenode), and they report back to the namenode
   periodically with lists of blocks that they are storing
4) STRUCTURE:
   1 namenode -> N children datanodes
   1 File -> N blocks -> can be part of multiple block pools
   1 block pool -> can interact with multiple namenodes via the latter datanotes
   1 namenode -> 1 namespace volume with blocks picked from block pools
   1 namenode -> N secondary namenode for backup

5) Failover controller governs the transition from the active namenode to the standby namenode
6) Fencing is the system to prevent the primary and standby from running simultaneously.
