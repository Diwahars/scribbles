A simple recommendation of writing modular Jython scripts for WebSphere Application Server administration. My knowledge of Jython and WebSphere is not great but the sight of huge scripts with global variables, methods and nested conditionals does not smell right. Python is known for its elegance and supports OOP, so the wsadmin scripts can have a makeover with some tips from Puppet scripts. Puppet written in Ruby, is used for machine configuration, basically setup a blank VM to production machine in short time, with required software like pgsql,java,ruby,http..etc coded as resources. For a WebSphere server configuration, resources like ldap, datasources, jvm, MQ/jms, mail, scheduler..etc can be split into modules.
