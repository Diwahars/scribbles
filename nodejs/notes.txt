NodeJs runs on a thread to serve all client requests unlike Apache which maps each request to a separate thread
Your code is never run parallel but when a IO operation is detected, nodejs makes use of asych IO and offloads the execution to a different thread
This simplicity in architecture is the key
when scaling is required, create MORE nodejs PROCESSES
when CPU intensive operations that will take time, use WebWorkers to fork off
No overhead of thread context switching with nodejs, as no connection pooling on request serving side.
