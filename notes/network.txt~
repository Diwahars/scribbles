1) DELAYS:

    	Probagation delay:    	
        Amount of time required for a message to travel from the sender to receiver, which is a function of distance over speed with which the signal propagates. 
	Propagation time is dictated by the distance and the medium through which the signal travels, the propagation speed is usually within a small constant factor of the speed of light

    	Transmission delay:
        Amount of time required to push all the packet’s bits into the link, which is a function of the packet’s length and data rate of the link. 
	Tansmission delay is dictated by the available data rate of the transmitting link and has nothing to do with the distance between the client and the server. 
        As an example, let’s assume we want to transmit a 10 Mb file over two links: 1 Mbps and 100 Mbps. 
	It will take 10 seconds to put the entire file on the “wire” over the 1 Mbps link and only 0.1 seconds over the 100 Mbps link.

	Processing delay:
	Amount of time required to process the packet header, check for bit-level errors, and determine the packet’s destination. Happens at routers, intermediate hops.
	Queuing delay:
	Amount of time the incoming packet is waiting in the queue until it can be processed. Waiting before routers.

2) LAST MILE LATENCY:
***********************
	Its the last link between ISP and home/office, which is the slowest.

3) BANDWIDTH:
*****************
	Optical fibers have a distinct advantage when it comes to bandwidth 
	because each fiber can carry many different wavelengths (channels) of light through a process known as wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). 
	Hence, the total bandwidth of a fiber link is the multiple of per-channel data rate and the number of multiplexed channels.

	The backbones, or the optic fiber links, that form the core data paths of the Internet are capable of moving hundreds of terabits per second. 
	However, the available capacity at the 	edges of the network is much, much less, and varies wildly based on deployed technology: 
	dial-up, DSL, cable, a host of wireless technologies, fiber-to-the-home, and even the performance of the local router.

Chap2: Building blocks of TCP/IP
*********************************
	IP: Internet Protocol is what provides the host-to-host routing and addressing,

	TCP: Transmission Control Protocol, is what provides the abstraction of a reliable network running over an unreliable channel.
	When you work with a TCP stream, you are guaranteed that all bytes sent will be identical with bytes received and that they will arrive in the same order to the client. 
	As such, TCP is optimized for accurate delivery, rather than a timely one.

	HTTP standard never specified TCP as underlying protocol, UDP could've be chosen.

	TCP HANDSHAKE:
	******************
	Every TCP connection starts with 3 step handshake:
	STEP1: SYN: Client picks a random sequence number x and sends a SYN packet, which may also include additional TCP flags and options.
	STEP2: SYN ACK: Server increments x by one, picks own random sequence number y, appends it own set of flags and options, and dispatches the response.
	STEP3: ACK:Client increments both x and y by one and completes the handshake by dispatching the last ACK packet in the handshake

	The delay(58ms London-NY) imposed by the three-way handshake makes new TCP connections expensive to create.
	It is one of the big reasons why connection reuse is a critical optimization for any application running over TCP.

	TCP Fast Open (TFO) is a mechanism, which allows data transfer within the SYN packet, could decrease HTTP transaction network latency
	Congestion Collapse can happen due to resistance between IP (DATAGRAM PROTOCOL) and TCP, leading to servers emiiting multiple copies of same packet.

	FLOW CONTROL:
	*****************
	Flow control is a mechanism to prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiverwith data it may not be able to process.
	The receiver may be busy, under heavy load, or	may only be willing to allocate a fixed amount of buffer space. 
	To address this, each side	of the TCP connection advertises its own receive window (rwnd), which communicates the size of the available buffer space to hold the incoming data.
