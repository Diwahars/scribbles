REACTIVE PROGRAMMING:
***************************
System react to events(event-driven), load(scalable), failures(resilient) and users(responsive).

event-driven: loosely coupled event handlers without blocking
scaling: across cores, nodes, location transparency(data could be anywhere), minimum shared state
reslience: supervisor hierarchies, revive from failures
responsive: responsive to users
