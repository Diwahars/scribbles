'Chap1: Requirements'
**********************
1|Business needs=>
	information required to make wise decisions,
	lots of interviews with stakeholders 
	a moving target that must be revisited often
2|Compliance=>
	Archived copies of data sources and subsequent stagings of data
	Proof of the complete transaction flow that changed any data
	Fully documented algorithms for allocations and adjustments
	Proof of security of the data copies over time, both on-line and off-line
3|Data Profiling=>
	systematic examination of the quality, scope, and context of a data source to allow an ETL system to be built.
	Corrective steps for bad data source:
		Elimination of some input fields completely
		Flagging of missing data and generation of special surrogate keys
		Best-guess automatic replacement of corrupted values
		Human intervention at the record level
		Development of a full-blown normalized representation of the data
4|Security=>
	best to use LDAP roles that GRANT privileges on table for end-users
	ETL team will have read-write privileges but in a secure firewalled environment.
5|Data Integration=>
	dimensions and fact must be agreed upon for the entire enterprise across systems
6|Data Latency=>
	time taken for final data to reach end end-users
	if urgent, the architecture of the ETL system must convert from batch oriented to streaming oriented
7|Archiving and staging=>
	Staging must be done at every stage of Extract, Clean, Conform, Deliver
	Conservartive approach is to also archive (store in permanent media for retrieval) at every stage.
8| End User delivery interfaces=>
	must not leave a complicated normalised schema for the end-users
