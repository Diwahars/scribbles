features like j2ee support, clustering, coherence caching, special spring suppport, network channels, work managers, domains,diagnostics and security

chap2- administration:
***********************
jython, web console, weblogic scripting tool (WLST), SNMP, command line util and config wizard.
1)  create domains
    a: manually => mkdir <some-path>/domain1; . $MW_HOME/wlserver/server/bin/setWLSEnv.sh  ; java weblogic.Server;
    this copies files from $MW_HOME to domain1, startWeblogic.sh for starting server
    b: using config wizard => $MW_HOME/wlserver/common/bin/config.sh
2)  migrate domains:
    a:s using pack/unpack commands
3)  your app config files stored in domains are archived and audited. Must be read-only in prod for sanity.
4)  recource adaptors exist for jdbc/jms etc. can be configured via admin console or scripts.
5)  The Node Manager is a utility for remote control of Administration Servers and Managed Servers. 
    It runs separately from WebLogic Server and lets you start up and shut down servers.
6)  deploy using console, scripting or deployment apis.
7)  Work Managers configure how your application prioritizes the execution of its work. 
    Based on rules you define and by monitoring actual run-time performance.
8)  Ant tasks are available. Agents are available to talk in SNMP protocol
9)  JMX, JEE Management APIs JSR77,Deployment APIs JSR88,diagnostics APIs are available.
10) Changes made to the console are staged and activate only by the Change Center. 
    Lock must be obtained and released to distribute your changes across servers.

chap3-domains
**************
1)  a domain is a logical collection of WebLogic Server services designed for a specific purpose 
2)  it can span across 1-* servers, 1-* clusters, locations, can be bound to a functional unit.
3)  one administration server/domain to control the managed servers. A bunch of managed servers with loadbalancing is called a cluster.
4)  a developer domain is a simple domain which packs the admin server and also hosts the apps.
5)  coherence clusters also follow the same domain concept.
6)  node manager concepts similar to websphere
7)  machine definition is a file used to link hardware with the server. used by the node manager.
8)  network channels define ports and protocols, used to link clients with servers. can be applied across managed servers.

chap4-clustering:
*****************
1)  a cluster cannot span across domains. a domain can contains multiple clusters, all managed by the single admin server.
2)  can be dynamic, where members can be added runtime, but must share the same server template.

chap5-deployment:
******************
1) for developer setup, copy archive (ear/war/jar) or exploded archive into the domain1/autodeploy; start server;
2) use admin console

chap6-data sources:
*******************
Generic Data Sources—Generic data sources and their connection pools provide connection management processes that help keep your system runsning efficiently.
Link Data Sources—An event-based data source that adaptively responds to state changes in an Oracle RAC instance.
Multi data sources—An abstraction around a group of generic data sources that provides load balancing or failover processing.
