 ROCKSDB,
An embeddable, persistent key-value store for fast storage that we built and use here at Facebook.
RocksDB builds on 'LevelDB', Google open source key value database library, to satisfy several goals:
vision:
      Scales to run on servers with many CPU cores.
      Uses fast storage efficiently.
      Is flexible to allow for innovation.
      Supports IO-bound, in-memory, and write-once workloads.

1.    RocksDB scales to run on servers with many CPU cores
            One advantage is that the semantics it provides are simpler than a traditional DBMS.
            For example, it supports MVCC, but only for read-only transactions.
            The database is logically partitioned into a read-only path and a read-write path.
            Both of these reduce the usage of locks, and reducing lock contention is a prerequisite for supporting high-concurrency workloads.
2.    RocksDB makes efficient use of storage -- more IOPS, improved compression, less write wear
            Compared to an update-in-place B-tree, it is possible to get better compression and less write amplification with a write-optimized database like RocksDB
            more IOPs with flash
3 .    Flexible architecture
            RocksDB code is manageable and easy to extend.
            For example, weâ€™ve added a merge operator that makes some updates write-only rather than read-modify-write, where "read" and "write" imply potential storage reads and writes.
            This reduces the amount of IO for some write-intensive workloads.
4.     RocksDB supports IO-bound, in-memory, and write-once workloads
            Work in progress to tune for one-time insert, in-memory workloads
            NOT a distributed database--rather the focus is on making an efficient, high-performance, single-node database engine.

ARCHITECTURE
1 is a C++ library that persistently stores keys and values.
         Keys and values are arbitrary byte streams, and keys are stored in sorted sequences.
         New writes occur to new places in the storage, and a background compaction process eliminates duplicates and processes delete markers.
         Data is stored in the form of a 'log-structured merge tree'. ( 2 trees , 1 in memory, 1 in disk with periodic reconciliation)
         There is support for atomically writing a set of keys into the database, and backward and forward iterations over the keys are supported.

2 is built using a "pluggable" architecture, which makes it easy to replace parts of it without impacting the overall architecture of the system.

3 organizes all data in sorted order and the common operations are
         'Get(key), Put(key), Delete(key) and Scan(key)'
4 basic constructs of RocksDB are 'memtable, sstfile and logfile'
         The memtable is an in-memory data structure - new writes are inserted into the memtable and are optionally written to the logfile.
         The logfile is a sequentially-written file on storage.
         When the memtable fills up, it is flushed to a sstfile on storage and the corresponding logfile can be safely deleted.
         The data in an sstfile is sorted to facilitate easy lookup of keys.
5 Gets, Iterators and Snapshots
         There is no limit to the size of a key or a value.
         'Get' is for single key, 'MultiGet' is for bulk call
         'Iterator' API allows an application to do a RangeScan on the database.
            The Iterator can seek to a specified key and then the application can start scanning one key at a time from that point
            Can also do rerverse scan
            works on a 'short-lived point-in-time view' of the database to maintain data integrity
            does not let go off its files until it is alive by keeping a reference count
         'Snapshot' API allows an application to create a 'long-lived' point-in-time view of a database
            does not prevent file deletions;
            instead the compaction process understands the existence of snapshots and promises never to delete a key that is visible in any existing snapshot.
            are not persisted across database restarts:
6 'Put' API will insert a single new key value pair
   'Write' API can take multiple keys (either insert new or override if already present) in 1 atomic transaction
7 Prefix Iterators help in effective range scanning by creating bloom filters for each key prefix  (either present or not answered quickly)
8 RocksDB uses a checksum to detect corruptions in storage. These checksums are for each block (typically between 4K to 128K in size). A block, once written to storage, is never modified.
