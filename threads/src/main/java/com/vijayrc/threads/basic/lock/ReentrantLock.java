/**
 * Intrinsic locks are reentrant, if a thread tries to acquire a lock that it already holds, the request succeeds.
 * Reentrancy means that locks are acquired on a per thread rather than per invocation basis.
 * Reentrancy is implemented by associating with each lock an acquisition count and an owning thread.
 * When the count is zero, the lock is considered unheld
 *
 * Simply put, reentrant is ability to repeatedly call synchronised methods on the same locked object
